# Holiday Planner

A travel agency wants to organize a trip holiday to a group of people.

This group of people has an established days of holidays called `days` and a certain budget called `budget`.

In that specific destination there is a list of activities that can be done, one activity is composed by `id`, `duration`, and `price`.

Considering that every day this group of people can only spend `4 hours` on activities, the mission is the following:

List as many possible activities that can be done in a x days considering the available time and the budget.
Display the activities from the lower to the higher duration, and if two or more activities have the same duration, display from the lower to the higher price.
