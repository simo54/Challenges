# Holiday Planner

A travel agency wants to organize a trip holiday to a group of people.

This group of people has established days of holidays called `days` and a certain budget called `budget`.

In that specific destination, there is a list of activities that can be done, one activity is composed of `id`, `description`, `duration`, and `price`.

Considering that every day this group of people can only spend `4 hours` on activities (can be only 1 or can be many), the mission is the following:

_List all the possible activities that can be done in `n` days considering the daily time at disposition and the total budget._

Display the activities from the lower to the higher duration, and if two or more activities have the same duration, display from the lower to the higher price.

List a final offer where budget and time are taken both in considerations when proposing a list of activities.
